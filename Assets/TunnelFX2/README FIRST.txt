How to use this asset
---------------------

Thanks for purchasing Tunnel FX 2.

Run the demo scene to get a first contact with the asset. It will allow you to change from one preset to another.

To add a tunnel to your scene:
- Click on top menu GameObject > 3D Object > TunnelFX2.

If you select your camera when adding the tunnel, it will be parented to that camera.
You can also position or change the scale of the tunnel. Default scale is 10x10x950.

Use the custom inspector to select a preset configuration or customize the effect. Some properties in the inspector shows a tooltip with some additional details.

Remember to remove the Demo folder once you don't need it anymore.


C# Scripting support
--------------------

Once you have a tunnel in your scene, you can access the script API from C#:

using TunnelEffect;

TunnelFX2 fx = TunnelFX2.instance;

fx.preset = TUNNEL_PRESET.xxx; (where xxx is one of the available presets defined in the enum TUNNEL_PRESET).

fx.globalAlpha = alpha; // changes transparency of tunnel (alpha = 0..1)

You can use alpha to make the tunnel invisible in the scene until you need it.
